Predictive analytics in social media has emerged as a critical area of research, providing insights into user behavior, content virality, and the dynamic interactions within social networks. This paper synthesizes findings from four seminal studies that employ various machine learning techniques to predict the popularity and virality of social media content. Through a comparative analysis of these methodologies, we identify key predictive factors and model efficacies, ranging from tweet volume and sentiment analysis to community structures and early engagement metrics. Our review highlights the nuanced roles these factors play in influencing content spread, offering robust strategies for content creators and digital marketers to enhance onlineÂ engagement.
